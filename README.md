# LC3BinaryStringToTextInstruction
I made this program to decrypt simple LC3 Binary String into more "readable" language. So instead of making constant look-ups in the LC3 Instruction Set, you can just paste the 16bit line in command prompt and it will tell you what it does. Feedback can be sent to: s224279@student.dtu.dk
